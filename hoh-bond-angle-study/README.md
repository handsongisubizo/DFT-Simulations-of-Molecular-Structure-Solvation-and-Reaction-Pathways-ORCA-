# H–O–H Angle Deformation in Water: Energy Profile

This project investigates how the potential energy of a single water molecule changes with variations in the **H–O–H bond angle**. Using **Density Functional Theory (DFT)** calculations performed in ORCA, single-point energies were computed across a range of fixed angles to generate a detailed **energy profile** of angular deformation.

## Methodology

- **System**: Single H₂O molecule  
- **Software**: ORCA for quantum chemistry; Python (Google Colab) for analysis  
- **Procedure**:
  - Begin from the optimized geometry of H₂O (equilibrium H–O–H angle ≈ 104.5°)
  - Fix O–H bond lengths and vary the **H–O–H bond angle** from 80° to 130° in 1° steps
  - Perform **single-point energy calculations** at each angle
  - Visualize and fit the energy curve using Python to extract the **angle force constant**

**Interaction Behavior**:
- **Repulsion**: Angle = 80° → High energy due to strong steric repulsion  
- **Equilibrium**: Angle ≈ 104.5° → Minimum energy configuration  
- **Deformation**: Angle = 130° → Higher energy due to orbital strain
