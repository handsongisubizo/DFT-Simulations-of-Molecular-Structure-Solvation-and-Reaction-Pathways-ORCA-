# Hâ€“Oâ€“H Angle Deformation in Water: Energy Profile

This project investigates how the potential energy of a single water molecule changes with variations in the **Hâ€“Oâ€“H bond angle**. Using **Density Functional Theory (DFT)** calculations performed in ORCA, single-point energies were computed across a range of fixed angles to generate a detailed **energy profile** of angular deformation.

## Methodology

- **System**: Single Hâ‚‚O molecule  
- **Software**: ORCA for quantum chemistry; Python (Google Colab) for analysis  
- **Procedure**:
  - Begin from the optimized geometry of Hâ‚‚O (equilibrium Hâ€“Oâ€“H angle â‰ˆ 105.2Â°)
  - Fix Oâ€“H bond lengths and vary the **Hâ€“Oâ€“H bond angle** from 60Â° to 180Â° in 0.1Â° steps
  - Perform **single-point energy calculations** at each angle
  - Visualize and fit the energy curve using python.

**Interaction Behavior**:
- **Repulsion**: Angle = 60Â° â†’ High energy due to strong steric repulsion  
- **Equilibrium**: Angle â‰ˆ 105.2Â° â†’ Minimum energy configuration  
- **Deformation**: Angle = 180Â° â†’ Higher energy due to orbital strain

## Energy Curve Fitting and Force Constant

To quantify the stiffness of **the Hâ€“Oâ€“H angle** in a water molecule, we performed a parabolic fit around the energy minimum.
