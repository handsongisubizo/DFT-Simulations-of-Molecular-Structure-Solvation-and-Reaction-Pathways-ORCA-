# Partial Atomic Charges of Water from ORCA

This project demonstrates how I used **ORCA** to compute the **partial atomic charges** of a single water molecule (Hâ‚‚O) using the **CHELPG method**. The results are then compared to several well-known water models commonly used in molecular dynamics and force field development.

## Molecular Structure

The water molecule shown below was used as the geometry input to compute CHELPG partial atomic charges using ORCA.

## CHELPG vs Standard Water Models

The plot compares CHELPG-derived charges from **ORCA** with established models such as **TIP3P**, **SPC/E**, **POL3**, and **TIP5P**. You can see that the ORCA result closely aligns with **POL3**, a DFT-informed force field, and also shows strong agreement with the other classical models â€” confirming the realism and reliability of the computed charges.

The table and plots were implemented in **Google Colab notebook** here: [Open orca-water-partial-charges.ipynb](./orca_water_partial_charges.ipynb)

## This simple analysis shows how quantum-derived charges:

- Are physically meaningful and symmetry-consistent
- Compare well with trusted classical models like **POL3**
