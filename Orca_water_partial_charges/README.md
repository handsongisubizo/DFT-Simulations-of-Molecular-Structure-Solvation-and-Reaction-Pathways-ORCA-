# Partial Atomic Charges of Water from ORCA

This project demonstrates how I used [**ORCA**](https://www.faccts.de/orca/) to compute the [**partial atomic charges**](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.0c01102) of a single water molecule (H₂O) using the [**CHELPG method**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHELPG). The results are then compared to several well-known water models commonly used in [molecular dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics) and [force field development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_field_(chemistry)).

## Molecular Structure

The water molecule shown below was used as the geometry input to compute CHELPG partial atomic charges using ORCA.

## CHELPG vs Standard Water Models

![Partial Charges plot Comparison](orca_vs_forcefiel_partial_charges.png)

The plot compares CHELPG-derived charges from **ORCA** with established models such as [**TIP3P**](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jp003020w), [**SPC/E**](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jp003020w), **POL3**, and [**TIP5P**](https://docs.lammps.org/Howto_tip5p.html). You can see that the ORCA result closely aligns with [**POL3**](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jp110391q), a DFT-informed force field, and also shows strong agreement with the other classical models — confirming the realism and reliability of the computed charges.

The table and plots were implemented in **Google Colab notebook** here: [Open orca-water-partial-charges.ipynb](./orca_water_partial_charges.ipynb)

## This simple analysis shows how quantum-derived charges:

- Are physically meaningful and symmetry-consistent
- Compare well with trusted classical models like **POL3**
