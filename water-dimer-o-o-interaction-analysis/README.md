# OÂ·Â·Â·O Interaction in Water Dimers: Energy Profile

This project analyzes the **non-bonded OÂ·Â·Â·O interaction** between two water molecules using **Density Functional Theory (DFT)** in **ORCA**. The interaction energy was computed as a function of the distance between the **oxygen atoms** of the donor and acceptor water molecules.


## Optimized Structure

## Methodology

- **System**: Hâ‚‚O dimer (1 donor, 1 acceptor)
- **Software**: ORCA for quantum calculations, Python (Colab) for analysis
- **Procedure**:
  - Start from an optimized hydrogen-bonded water dimer geometry.
  - Fix atomic positions and vary the **OÂ·Â·Â·O distance** from 2.00 Ã… to 5.00 Ã… in 0.001 Ã… steps.
  - Perform single-point energy calculations for each configuration.
  - Analyze and visualize the interaction energy profile using Python.

## OÂ·Â·Â·O Interaction Distance Profile

This figure illustrates how the non-bonded OÂ·Â·Â·O interaction between two water molecules changes with distance:

**Interaction Behavior**:
- **Repulsion**: OÂ·Â·Â·O = 2.00 Ã… â†’ Strong electronic repulsion due to orbital overlap  
- **Equilibrium**: OÂ·Â·Â·O = 2.901 Ã… â†’ Minimum energy point (âˆ’152.86248 Eh)  
- **No Interaction**: OÂ·Â·Â·O â‰¥ 5.00 Ã… â†’ Long-range distance, interaction vanishes

Input/Output Files
------------------
Over 2000 ORCA input/output files were generated by scanning OÂ·Â·Â·O distances.

To explore a sample calculation, see:

ðŸ”¹ Input:  [OO_scan_2.901.inp](./inputs/ OO_scan_2.901.inp)  
ðŸ”¹ Output: [OO_scan_2.901.out](./outputs/ OO_scan_2.901.out)

## Energy Profile

The interaction energy curve shows a minimum at 2.901 Ã…, which corresponds to the most stable OÂ·Â·Â·O distance in the hydrogen-bonded water dimer.
- At shorter distances, strong repulsion arises due to electron cloud overlap.
- At longer distances, the attractive interaction fades.
