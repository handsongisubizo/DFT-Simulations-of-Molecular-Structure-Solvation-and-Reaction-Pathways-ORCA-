# O···O Interaction in Water Dimers: Energy Profile

This project analyzes the **non-bonded O···O interaction** between two water molecules using **Density Functional Theory (DFT)** in **ORCA**. The interaction energy was computed as a function of the distance between the **oxygen atoms** of the donor and acceptor water molecules.

## Methodology

- **System**: H₂O dimer (1 donor, 1 acceptor)
- **Software**: ORCA for quantum calculations, Python (Colab) for analysis
- **Procedure**:
  - Start from an optimized hydrogen-bonded water dimer geometry.
  - Fix atomic positions and vary the **O···O distance** from 2.00 Å to 5.00 Å in 0.001 Å steps.
  - Perform single-point energy calculations for each configuration.
  - Analyze and visualize the interaction energy profile using Python.

## O···O Interaction Distance Profile

This figure illustrates how the non-bonded O···O interaction between two water molecules changes with distance:

**Interaction Behavior**:
- **Repulsion**: O···O = 2.00 Å → Strong electronic repulsion due to orbital overlap  
- **Equilibrium**: O···O = 2.901 Å → Minimum energy point (−152.86248 Eh)  
- **No Interaction**: O···O ≥ 5.00 Å → Long-range distance, interaction vanishes

## Energy Profile

The interaction energy curve shows a minimum at 2.901 Å, which corresponds to the most stable O···O distance in the hydrogen-bonded water dimer.
- At shorter distances, strong repulsion arises due to electron cloud overlap.
- At longer distances, the attractive interaction fades.

Lennard-Jones Parameter Calculation (ε and σ)

O···O interaction energies were computed using ORCA (B3LYP-D4/def2-TZVP) from 2.850 Å to 2.950 Å in 0.0001 Å steps.

Minimum energy (E_min) = –152.86248025 Eh at r_min = 2.901 Å  
Energy at 2.851 Å = –152.86242233 Eh

 1: Epsilon (ε)
ΔE = 0.00005792 Eh  
ε = 0.00005792 × 627.509 = 0.0363 kcal/mol

 2: Sigma (σ)
σ = r_min / 2^(1/6) = 2.901 / 1.12246 = 2.584 Å

Final Lennard-Jones Parameters:
ε = 0.0363 kcal/mol  
σ = 2.584 Å
